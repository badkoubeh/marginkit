"""Robustness-margin estimation: thresholds with confidence intervals.

marginkit's break-point and censoring **conventions** come from zeta-bench
(``robustness/cards.py::break_point``). Its dose-response **estimation is new**. See
``docs/PROVENANCE.md``.

As of ``0.1.0a2`` this package exports the full v1 contract: the vocabulary types
(:class:`Axis`, :class:`Observations`, :class:`Definition`, :class:`Cell`), the status and
interval-shape enums (:class:`Status`, :class:`IntervalShape`, alongside the existing
:class:`Censoring`), the result dataclasses (:class:`Fit`, :class:`Threshold`, :class:`Ratio`,
:class:`Scorecard`), the grid break-point rule (:func:`grid_break_point`, returning
:class:`GridBreakPoint`), and the dose-response fitter (:func:`fit_dose_response`, returning a
:class:`Fit` whose :meth:`~Fit.predict` returns a :class:`Prediction`). The JSON report module
(``marginkit.report``) and the schema-valid test fakes (``marginkit.testing``) are importable
as submodules but are not re-exported here.

As of ``0.1.0a3`` this release adds :func:`threshold`, which solves for the severity at which
a fitted curve crosses a target performance and attaches an interval or an explicit censoring
label (plan §5.3-§5.5), together with :class:`BaselineRate`, :class:`ExactRates` and
:func:`per_cell_clopper_pearson`.

As of ``0.1.0a4`` this release adds :func:`ratio_interval`, which solves for the ratio of two
thresholds' severities with a Fieller or log-delta confidence interval (plan §5.6).

As of ``0.1.0`` this release adds :class:`Diagnostics` and :func:`diagnose` (model-only goodness
of fit, dispersion and link comparison for a converged :class:`Fit`, plan §5.7), and
:class:`MonotonicityCheck`, :class:`AdjacentPair` and :func:`check_monotonicity` (a data-only
adjacent-severity-level check that needs only raw counts, computed on every
:func:`fit_dose_response` return path regardless of ``Status`` -- `decisions/0023`, as amended by
that decision's "Amendment 1"). Both are reported and never acted on automatically: neither
changes a fitted parameter, a reported threshold, or which link a caller chose.

Note that ``marginkit.threshold`` is now the *function*, not the submodule.

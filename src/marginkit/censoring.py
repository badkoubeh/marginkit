"""Censoring classification (plan section 5.5) and exact one-sided bounds (`decisions/0009`).

Public: :func:`exact_one_sided_bound`, the one piece of numeric machinery every rule in this
module (and :func:`marginkit.empirical.per_cell_clopper_pearson`) is built from -- the exact
arithmetic lives in exactly one place, here. Internal: :func:`classify`, which turns a
:class:`~marginkit.Fit` plus an already-resolved target performance into a
:class:`Classification` describing which of plan section 5.5's outcomes applies.

Classification order (plan section 5.5's table is a list of conditions, not a sequence; this is
the sequence, per `decisions/0008`, `0009`, `0011`, `0012`):

1. ``fit.status is CONTROL_INCOMPATIBLE`` -- terminal mirror.
2. ``FAILS_AT_BASELINE`` -- the zero-severity control's exact one-sided bound at ``level``
   already fails the target, and no other tested level passes it (`decisions/0008`, `0011`: a
   control failure contradicted by a later passing level is a monotonicity contradiction, not a
   clean baseline failure, and belongs to step 7 instead). Short-circuits before ``UNREACHABLE``.
3. ``UNREACHABLE`` -- the target is not strictly inside ``(l, u)``. Only checked when
   ``fit.status is OK``, since reachability needs a fitted ``l``/``u`` (`decisions/0008`).
4. ``RIGHT`` -- the highest tested level's one-sided *lower* bound at ``level`` still clears the
   target.
5. ``LEFT`` -- the lowest *nonzero* tested level's one-sided *upper* bound at ``level`` fails the
   target, and the control's one-sided lower bound clears it (`decisions/0012`: evaluated on the
   data, so this and ``RIGHT`` are reachable on a converged fit too).
6. ``fit.status is OK`` and neither ``RIGHT`` nor ``LEFT`` fired -- solve (the caller runs the
   requested interval method); ``Classification.solve`` is ``True``.
7. Otherwise (``SEPARATION``/``NOT_CONVERGED``) -- the exact-bound fallback: attach the grid
   value, then build a two-sided bracket from every tested cell (control included), each side at
   ``(1 + level) / 2`` (`decisions/0009`, so joint coverage is at least ``level``). A bracket
   whose largest confidently-passing severity is not below its smallest confidently-failing one
   contradicts monotonicity; report no bounds at all with both levels named in a warning
   (`decisions/0011`), keeping the fit's own status.

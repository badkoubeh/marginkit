"""The dose-response fit result, its fitting entry point, and prediction.

As of ``0.1.0a2`` this module holds :class:`Fit`, the two small dataclasses it embeds
(:class:`Parameter`, :class:`Covariance`), :func:`fit_dose_response`, and :class:`Prediction`
(:meth:`Fit.predict`'s return type). Two fitting paths exist (plan §5.1, D7 ``decisions/0004``):
statsmodels ``GLM`` when both asymptotes are fixed at exactly ``1.0``/``0.0``, and
``statsmodels.base.model.GenericLikelihoodModel`` -- given a likelihood function, never a
hand-rolled optimizer or IRLS loop -- otherwise. A fit with no interior maximum (wrong-sign
slope, or an estimated asymptote pinned to a parameter-space boundary) is reported as
``Status.NOT_CONVERGED`` with the reason in ``Fit.warnings``, never as a number that happens to
be where the optimizer stopped (``decisions/0005``).

**v1 is binomial-only.** ``model`` accepts only ``"binomial"``; a new model family (``"ll4"``,
``"isotonic"``) is a v0.2 addition that requires ``schema_version`` ``"2"``, not a silent
extension of this one.

    plan section 5.1 item 6, R8). Never serialised (``report.py`` does not know this type): it
    is a throwaway array bundle, not a stored result, per the Phase 4 plan's owner answer.

    Two band scales are used, chosen by :meth:`Fit.predict` from which asymptotes were
    estimated -- documented in full on :meth:`Fit.predict` itself, since the choice depends on
    the ``Fit`` being predicted from, not on this type.

    ``eq``/``hash`` are disabled (unlike every other result dataclass in this package): the
    default dataclass equality would compare ``numpy`` arrays element-by-element and then try to
    coerce that into a single ``bool``, which raises. Two ``Prediction`` instances are therefore
    never equal unless they are the same object (Python's default identity-based ``__eq__``,
    from ``object``, applies instead) -- do not write ``fit.predict(x) == fit.predict(x)``
    expecting a value comparison; compare the four arrays individually instead.

    All four arrays are read-only (``.flags.writeable is False``): this is a frozen dataclass,
    but freezing only stops an attribute from being *reassigned* (``prediction.lo = ...``), not
    the ``numpy`` array it refers to from being mutated in place (``prediction.lo[:] = ...``),
    so ``__post_init__`` marks each array non-writeable itself to close that gap.

    A scalar ``severity`` argument to :meth:`Fit.predict` (for example ``fit.predict(0.5)``,
    rather than a list or array) gives 0-d arrays here (``severity.shape == ()``), following
    :func:`numpy.asarray`'s own behaviour for a scalar input; it is never promoted to shape

    The fitted curve (§5.1) is ``P(x) = u - (u - l) * F(z)``, where ``z = (log(x) - mu) / s`` on
    a log axis or ``z = (x - mu) / s`` on a linear axis, ``s > 0``, and ``F`` is the link's CDF
    (the standard normal CDF for ``probit``, the logistic CDF for ``logit``, or
    ``1 - exp(-exp(z))`` for ``cloglog``, which models the probability of *failure* rising with
    severity and so is not symmetric the way ``probit``/``logit`` are). ``mu`` is on the
    transformed axis (``log x`` on a log axis, ``x`` on a linear axis), not on the original
    severity scale. At ``z = 0`` -- severity ``exp(mu)`` on a log axis, or severity ``mu`` on a
    linear axis -- ``probit`` and ``logit`` both give ``P = (u + l) / 2``: the midpoint of the
    fitted dynamic range, :meth:`~marginkit.Definition.relative` ``(0.5)``, for **any**
    asymptotes ``u``, ``l``, because the standard normal and logistic CDFs each equal ``0.5``
    at ``z = 0``. That midpoint equals :meth:`~marginkit.Definition.absolute` ``(0.5)`` and
    :meth:`~marginkit.Definition.baseline_fraction` ``(0.5)`` only when ``u = 1`` and
    ``l = 0``. Under ``cloglog``, which is not symmetric around ``z = 0``,
    ``F(0) = 1 - exp(-1)`` (about ``0.632``), so ``mu`` is never the midpoint of the dynamic
    range, for any asymptotes. Each entry in ``params`` records whether it was held fixed or
    estimated, and is on the **natural scale**, never the optimiser's internal
    reparametrisation (``log s``; ``upper``/``lower`` on a logit scale) -- see
    :class:`Parameter`. ``covariance`` is on that same natural scale: when asymptotes are
    estimated, the optimiser's own covariance (which is on its reparametrised scale) is
    delta-transformed onto the natural scale before being stored here.

    ``status == Status.OK`` if and only if both ``params`` and ``log_likelihood`` are present;
    when ``status`` is anything else, ``params``, ``covariance`` and ``log_likelihood`` are all
    ``None`` -- no number is ever produced for a failed fit (hard constraint 3).
    ``Status.UNREACHABLE`` and ``Status.FAILS_AT_BASELINE`` describe a *threshold*, not a fit
    (they depend on a ``Definition`` a ``Fit`` does not have), and are never a ``Fit.status``.

    Binomial curves are decreasing-only in this release: ``direction="increasing"`` raises,
    pending owner decision D5's restatement of the definitions for an increasing-is-worse
    outcome (§5.3). ``Observations`` itself still accepts both directions.

    ``predict()`` (curve and band evaluation, R8) arrives in Phase 4. ``diagnostics``
    (goodness-of-fit, dispersion, monotonicity, link comparison, §5.7) arrives in Phase 7 as an
    appended field defaulting to ``None``, which is a safe addition under Appendix B.

    Attributes
    ----------
    axis
        The :class:`~marginkit.Axis` the fit was made on.
    outcome
        The outcome name this fit was made against, carried over from the
        :class:`~marginkit.Observations` it was fit to.
    direction
        ``"decreasing"`` only, in this release (see above).
    model
        The model family. Only ``"binomial"`` exists in v0.1 (schema ``"1"``); a new family
        such as ``"ll4"`` or ``"isotonic"`` is a v0.2 addition requiring ``schema_version``
        ``"2"``.
    link
        The link function: ``"probit"``, ``"logit"`` or ``"cloglog"`` for ``model="binomial"``.
        Required; the schema's ``link`` enum carries no ``null`` alternative, so this is a
        genuine ``str``, never ``None``.
    params
        A mapping with exactly the keys ``{"mu", "s", "upper", "lower"}`` when ``status`` is
        ``OK``, else ``None``. ``s.value`` must be positive; ``lower.value`` and
        ``upper.value`` must each lie in ``[0, 1]`` with ``lower.value < upper.value``.
        ``params["mu"].fixed`` and ``params["s"].fixed`` must both be ``False``: this package
        never produces (and this dataclass never accepts) an ``OK`` fit with a fixed location
        or scale.
    covariance
        The estimated parameters' covariance. Required (not ``None``) when ``status`` is
        ``OK``; ``None`` otherwise. If present, ``covariance.names`` is exactly the set of
        non-fixed parameter names.
    log_likelihood
        The fitted log-likelihood, or ``None`` when ``status`` is not ``OK``. Finite when
        present.
    cells
        The per-severity-level pooled counts the fit was made from
        (:meth:`~marginkit.Observations.cells`). Never empty.
    status
        The :class:`~marginkit.Status` of this fit. Never ``UNREACHABLE`` or
        ``FAILS_AT_BASELINE`` (those describe a threshold, not a fit).
    cluster_ids
        Optional cluster ids the fitted data carries, one instance per distinct cluster (not
        one per row): unique, non-empty when given, and never ``None`` or ``bool`` elements.
        Set whenever the input :class:`~marginkit.Observations` carried cluster ids, whatever
        dependence was assumed when this fit was produced -- this field reflects the data's
        structure, not a modelling choice. ``None`` means only that the data had no clusters,
        not that independence was assumed. Used by :class:`~marginkit.Ratio`'s dependence
        guard (§5.6).
    warnings
        Free-text notes surfaced alongside the fit (for example, ``CONTROL_INCOMPATIBLE``
        carries a message suggesting ``upper="estimate"``). Empty by default.
    schema_version
        The serialised-result schema version this object belongs to. Defaults to ``"1"``.
    provenance
        An opaque mapping the caller may attach to record where the inputs came from.
        marginkit stores it and never interprets it. Empty by default.

        ``severity`` (plan section 5.1 item 6).

        Two band scales are used, depending on which asymptotes this fit estimated:

        - **Both asymptotes fixed:** the delta method is applied to the linear predictor ``z``
          (using ``mu``'s and ``s``'s covariance), then mapped through
          ``P = u - (u - l) * F(z)``. Because ``u`` and ``l`` are constants here, the band is
          guaranteed to stay inside ``(l, u)`` -- not just ``(0, 1)`` -- for every severity.
        - **Either asymptote estimated:** the delta method is applied to ``logit(P)``, using
          the gradient of ``logit(P)`` with respect to every *estimated* natural parameter
          (``mu``, ``s``, and whichever of ``lower``/``upper`` are not fixed), then
          back-transformed with the logistic function. The band is guaranteed to stay inside
          ``(0, 1)``, but not inside ``(l, u)`` specifically, since ``l``/``u`` themselves now
          carry uncertainty.

        On a log axis, severity ``0.0`` is always the zero-severity control (R3): its estimate
        is ``upper`` exactly, never computed through ``log(0)``. It is not a special case for
        the band, either: it goes through the same computation as every other severity (so
        ``predict(0)`` and ``predict(1e-12)`` agree), which happens to give a zero-width band
        there whenever ``upper`` is fixed (perturbing any other parameter cannot move a
        constant) and a band from ``Var(upper)`` -- correctly propagated through ``logit``, not
        treated as if it were already on the logit scale -- when ``upper`` is estimated.

        Parameters
        ----------
        severity
            Severities to evaluate the curve at. Converted to ``float64``; every entry must be
            finite and non-negative.
        level
            The two-sided confidence level for the band, strictly between 0 and 1 (not a
            ``bool``). Defaults to ``0.95``.

        Returns
        -------
        Prediction
            ``severity``, ``estimate``, ``lo`` and ``hi`` are ``numpy`` arrays of the same

    """Fit a binomial dose-response curve to ``obs`` (plan section 4's Public API, section 5.1).

    Two fitting paths (D7 ``decisions/0004``): statsmodels ``GLM`` when both ``upper`` and
    ``lower`` are fixed at exactly ``1.0``/``0.0``; ``statsmodels``
    ``GenericLikelihoodModel`` -- given a likelihood, never a hand-rolled optimizer or IRLS loop
    -- for every other combination of fixed and estimated asymptotes. Both paths are checked for
    separation before fitting (plan section 5.1 item 3) and for a non-interior maximum after
    fitting (``decisions/0005``); either gives an explicit :class:`~marginkit.Status` with no
    numbers, never a value that merely happens to be where the optimizer stopped.

    Parameters
    ----------
    obs
        The severity/outcome data to fit. Aggregated and per-observation ``Observations`` that
        pool to the same cells give numerically identical fits (R1): everything below is a
        deterministic function of ``obs.cells()``, not of row order or representation.
    model
        Only ``"binomial"`` exists in this release.
    link
        ``"probit"``, ``"logit"`` or ``"cloglog"``. Fixed by the caller before the data is
        seen (plan section 5.7): this function never compares links and picks one for you.
    upper, lower
        Each either a fixed probability in ``[0, 1]``, or the literal string ``"estimate"``.
        Required, with no default (a wrong default would silently change what curve is fit).

    Returns
    -------
    Fit
        ``status`` is :data:`~marginkit.Status.OK` with all four natural-scale parameters and
        a covariance over the estimated ones, or one of :data:`~marginkit.Status.SEPARATION`,
        :data:`~marginkit.Status.NOT_CONVERGED` or :data:`~marginkit.Status.CONTROL_INCOMPATIBLE`
        with no numbers and a reason in ``warnings``. ``cluster_ids`` mirrors ``obs.cluster``
        whatever the outcome (R2's dependence guard is enforced downstream, in
        :class:`~marginkit.Ratio`, not here).

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If ``model``/``link`` is not one of the values above, if ``obs.direction`` is not
        ``"decreasing"`` (an increasing-is-worse curve is pending owner decision D5; ``Fit``
        itself rejects it), if ``upper``/``lower`` is not a valid probability or ``"estimate"``,
        or if both are fixed with ``upper <= lower``.

"""The ratio-of-two-thresholds result (§5.6) and :func:`ratio_interval`, which computes one.

:func:`ratio_interval` solves the classic Fieller quadratic --
``{rho : A*rho^2 - 2*B*rho + K <= 0}`` for ``A = theta_b^2 - z^2*Vb``,
``B = theta_a*theta_b - z^2*C``, ``K = theta_a^2 - z^2*Va`` (``C = 0`` under
``dependence="independent"``) -- on the *natural* severity scale, or the log-delta interval
(``log(ratio)``, variance ``Va + Vb`` on the log scale, exponentiated back around the estimate).
Both reuse the exact per-threshold delta-method variance :mod:`marginkit.intervals` already
computes for a single threshold's own interval (``intervals._theta_variance``), rather than
reassembling the gradient a second time.

**A note on three different things all called ``theta``.** Plan section 5.6's Fieller paragraph
writes ``theta`` for a threshold's value on the *original* severity scale
(:attr:`Threshold.value`); its log-delta paragraph writes ``theta`` for ``log(x*)``; and
:mod:`marginkit.intervals` writes ``theta`` for yet a third thing, the axis it actually optimises
over (``log(severity)`` on a log axis, raw severity on a linear one). All three coincide only on
a log axis. Fieller here always converts ``intervals``' transformed-scale ``Var(theta)`` to the
natural scale via the delta method's own chain rule for ``value = exp(theta)`` on a log axis
(``Var(value) = value^2 * Var(theta)``) or the identity map on a linear axis (``value = theta``,
so ``Var(value) = Var(theta)`` directly) -- see ``_fieller_variance``'s docstring for why this is
computed directly rather than through a ``value^2 * sigma_log^2`` round trip (the two agree
wherever ``value != 0``; the direct route has no removable singularity at ``value == 0`` on a
linear axis).

Several questions plan section 5.6 itself left open are settled by owner decisions rather than
guessed at here: a censored or failed input threshold propagates a status/censoring flag with no
numbers, direction-aware for which side is censored (`decisions/0015`); ``level=None`` inherits
from the two inputs, which must agree, and an explicit mismatching ``level`` also raises
(`decisions/0016`); a Fieller lower root below zero is intersected with the positive parameter
space -- ``lo = 0.0``, ``shape`` stays ``BOUNDED``, the unclipped root goes in ``warnings``
(`decisions/0019`); an ``EXCLUSIVE``-candidate set whose two roots are both negative is exactly
the whole positive axis, not a two-ray set to clip -- reported as ``UNBOUNDED``
(`decisions/0021`); a ``log_delta`` interval too wide to exponentiate raises rather than
inventing a shape ``Ratio`` has no member for (`decisions/0020`); and, settling what turned out
to be the common case rather than the rare one measured at ~24% of reachable results,
``IntervalShape`` gains ``HALF_OPEN`` for the Fieller half-line that `decisions/0017`'s
``A == 0`` boundary and `decisions/0021`'s ``EXCLUSIVE``-candidate branch each turn out to
produce when ``K > 0`` -- superseding `0017` in part, narrowing `0021`, and moving
``schema_version`` to ``"2"`` (`decisions/0022`; the ``dependence="independent"`` guard's
shared-``Fit`` check, meanwhile, moved from :class:`Ratio` to this function, a public-API
decision recorded against `decisions/0018`'s amendment).

class Ratio:
    """The ratio of two thresholds' severities, on the same axis, with a confidence interval.

    A Fieller-type interval is not always a single bounded interval (§5.6): ``shape`` records
    which geometry ``lo``/``hi`` describe, and that geometry is never clipped to look bounded
    when it isn't.

    **A failed or censored ratio carries no numbers.** Whenever ``status`` is not ``OK`` or
    ``censoring`` is not ``NONE``, ``shape``, ``estimate``, ``lo`` and ``hi`` are all ``None`` --
    :func:`ratio_interval` propagates the input thresholds' status/censoring rather than
    reporting a number, direction-aware for which side is censored (`decisions/0015`). Only on
    the ``OK`` + ``NONE`` path is ``shape`` required to be set, along with the numbers it
    governs.

    Attributes
    ----------
    threshold_a, threshold_b
        The two :class:`~marginkit.Threshold` results the ratio is between (``a / b``). Their
        axes must match on ``name`` and ``unit`` (R5), and their ``definition`` must be equal
        (a ratio between two different target-performance definitions is not one number); a
        mismatch on either raises. With ``dependence="independent"``, the two fits must not be
        the very same object (``threshold_a.fit is threshold_b.fit``, object identity only --
        `decisions/0018`'s amendment) and must not share a cluster id (§5.6). Both checks are
        **necessary, not sufficient**: together they can only see object identity and the
        ``cluster_ids`` a :class:`~marginkit.Fit` records, not whether the two series were drawn
        from overlapping observations that carry no cluster id. Equal fits **by value** are not
        rejected: two disjoint samples can produce identical counts, and that ratio is valid --
        only the identical *object* is refused. ``ratio_interval`` checks only object identity
        and ``cluster_ids``, for exactly this reason: a full shared-data check would need an
        observation id that nothing in the package records yet (`decisions/0018`, deferred to
        v0.2's paired dependence work).
    estimate
        The point estimate of the ratio. Required and equal to
        ``threshold_a.value / threshold_b.value`` (``math.isclose``, ``rel_tol=1e-9``) when
        ``status`` is ``OK`` and ``censoring`` is ``NONE``; ``None`` otherwise.
    lo, hi
        The interval endpoints, read according to ``shape``, only when ``status`` is ``OK`` and
        ``censoring`` is ``NONE``:

        - ``BOUNDED``: ``[lo, hi]``, both set, ``lo <= hi``, and ``lo <= estimate <= hi``.
          ``method="log_delta"`` additionally requires ``lo > 0``. Also covers a Fieller set
          bounded above but not below on its own, intersected to ``[0, hi]`` (`decisions/0019`);
          ``HALF_OPEN`` is never used for that case (`decisions/0022`).
        - ``UNBOUNDED``: both ``None`` (the whole real line, or the positive parameter space
          when intersected -- see `decisions/0021`); it carries ``estimate``.
        - ``EXCLUSIVE``: both set, ``lo < hi`` strictly, meaning
          ``(-inf, lo] union [hi, inf)``, and ``estimate`` lies in that union (``estimate <=
          lo`` or ``estimate >= hi``) -- the point estimate always lies inside the Fieller
          confidence set, never in the excluded gap. **Unreachable via ``ratio_interval`` in
          v0.1** (`decisions/0022`): the invariant stays enforced for a directly-constructed
          ``Ratio`` and for v0.2's ``dependence="paired"``.
        - ``HALF_OPEN``: ``lo`` set, ``hi`` is ``None``, meaning ``[lo, inf)``, and
          ``lo <= estimate``. ``method="log_delta"`` additionally requires ``lo > 0``, as for
          ``BOUNDED``. This is what plan section 5.6's original two-ray case actually is once
          intersected with the positive parameter space -- ~24% of reachable Fieller results,
          not a rare case (`decisions/0022`).

        Both ``None`` otherwise.
    shape
        The :class:`~marginkit.IntervalShape` of ``(lo, hi)`` when ``status`` is ``OK`` and
        ``censoring`` is ``NONE``; ``None`` otherwise (including when ``status``/``censoring``
        make a shape meaningless).
    method
        ``"fieller"`` or ``"log_delta"``. ``"log_delta"`` additionally requires, on the
        ``OK`` + ``NONE`` path, that ``threshold_a.axis.scale`` and ``threshold_b.axis.scale``
        are both ``"log"`` and that ``threshold_a.value`` and ``threshold_b.value`` are both
        ``> 0`` (the log-scale delta method is undefined off the log axis or through zero).
    dependence
        ``"independent"`` in v0.1 (v0.2 adds ``"paired"``, §5.6). With ``"independent"``, the
        two thresholds' fits must not share a cluster id.
    level
        The confidence level, strictly between 0 and 1.
    censoring
        The :class:`~marginkit.Censoring` propagated from the input thresholds
        (`decisions/0015`), direction-aware: read against the ratio itself, not against either
        threshold's own tested range.
    status
        The :class:`~marginkit.Status` of this ratio.
    warnings
        Free-text notes surfaced alongside the ratio. Empty by default.
    schema_version
        The serialised-result schema version this object belongs to. Defaults to ``"2"``
        (`decisions/0022`, which added :data:`~marginkit.IntervalShape.HALF_OPEN`);
        ``from_dict`` still reads a ``"1"`` card, whose ``shape`` was never ``HALF_OPEN``.
    provenance
        An opaque mapping the caller may attach to record where the inputs came from.
        marginkit stores it and never interprets it. Empty by default.

        id. All three are :class:`Ratio`'s own ``__post_init__`` invariants and are not
        duplicated here -- they fire when the resulting :class:`Ratio` is constructed, on every
        path through this function.
    method
        ``"fieller"`` or ``"log_delta"``.
    dependence
        ``"independent"`` only, in this release. ``"paired"`` raises, naming that it is v0.2
        Phase 9 work (mirrors :func:`marginkit.threshold`'s own guard for the same request).
        Under ``"independent"``, ``t_a.fit`` and ``t_b.fit`` must not be the same object and
        must not share a cluster id -- both checks are necessary but **not sufficient** for
        actual independence (`decisions/0018` and its amendment).

        **This function does not verify independence; establishing it is the caller's

        a ``Ratio`` whose stated coverage is wrong -- silently, because there is nothing left in
        the package to check it against. This is a documented limitation (`decisions/0018`), not
        a guarantee this function makes.
    level
        ``None`` (the default) inherits the confidence level from ``t_a``/``t_b``, which must
        agree; an explicit ``level`` that disagrees with either also raises (`decisions/0016`)
        -- there is no silently-assumed default.

    Returns
    -------
    Ratio
        If either input is censored or has a failed :class:`~marginkit.Status`, the returned
        ``Ratio`` carries a propagated status/censoring flag and no numbers at all
        (`decisions/0015`) -- never a one-sided bound built by mixing an exact censoring bound
        in one threshold with a model-fitted value and its sampling error in the other.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        On any of: ``t_a.fit is t_b.fit`` under ``dependence="independent"`` (checked directly
        by this function, `decisions/0018` amendment); mismatched axis name/unit, mismatched
        ``definition``, or shared cluster ids under ``dependence="independent"`` (via
        :class:`Ratio`'s own validation, once this function reaches the point of constructing
        one); ``method`` outside ``{"fieller", "log_delta"}``; ``dependence`` anything other than
        ``"independent"`` (``"paired"`` gets its own message, naming it v0.2 work); ``level``
        outside ``(0, 1)``, or a ``level`` mismatch per `decisions/0016`; ``threshold_b.value ==
        0`` (nothing to divide by); for ``method="log_delta"`` once both inputs are
        ``(OK, NONE)``, either axis not ``scale="log"`` or either ``value`` not ``> 0``; for
        ``method="log_delta"``, a combined log-scale standard error too large to exponentiate
        finitely (`decisions/0020`); or, for ``method="fieller"``, a non-finite per-threshold
        variance (S2, Phase 6 stats review).

"""Fit diagnostics (model-only) and the data-only adjacent-level monotonicity check (plan
section 5.7; ``docs/decisions/0023-fit-diagnostics-and-schema-v3.md``, as amended by that
decision's "Amendment 1" (monotonicity moves onto ``Fit`` directly), "Amendment 2" (the
structural goodness-of-fit exclusion and the ``SPARSE_CELLS: `` warning), "Amendment 3" (that
warning fires only on an observed event, not a bare small expectation) and "Amendment 4" (the
warning's expected-count cutoff, tightened to below ``0.1``)).

Two independent things live here, deliberately kept apart (Amendment 1's own rationale):

- :class:`Diagnostics` / :func:`diagnose` need a converged fit -- goodness of fit, dispersion,
  and link comparison are all statements about how well a fitted curve matches the data, so they
  are ``None`` whenever :attr:`~marginkit.Fit.status` is not :data:`~marginkit.Status.OK`
  (hard constraint 3, read as "no model-derived numbers on a failed fit").
- :class:`MonotonicityCheck` / :func:`check_monotonicity` need only raw per-level counts -- an
  exact one-sided Fisher test on adjacent severity levels, Holm-corrected across the family. It
  therefore runs on *every* :func:`~marginkit.fit_dose_response` return path, whatever the
  ``Status``, because non-monotone data is a common cause of a failed fit and disappearing the
  check exactly then would hide the finding it exists to surface.

Both are reported and never acted on automatically (plan section 5.7): nothing here changes a
reported number, chooses a link, or corrects for dispersion. ``Fit.link`` stays whatever the
caller passed.

    (plan section 5.7, ``decisions/0023`` as amended by that decision's "Amendment 1", which
    moved the monotonicity check off this type entirely -- see :class:`MonotonicityCheck`).

    Built only from a converged fit (:func:`diagnose` requires ``fit.status is Status.OK``), and

    Attributes
    ----------
    deviance
        The binomial deviance on the per-severity-level cells, or ``None`` when ``df <= 0``
        (see ``df`` below) -- not a failed fit, just no goodness-of-fit statistic to report. A
        cell is excluded from this sum only when it is *structurally* deterministic under the
        model -- a log-axis cell at severity exactly ``0.0`` when ``upper`` is *fixed* at exactly
        ``1.0`` (``direction="decreasing"``); that cell has zero variance and zero deviance by
        construction (`decisions/0023` Amendment 2, item 1). Every other cell counts, including
        one whose fitted probability happens to round to exactly ``0`` or ``1`` in double
        precision: probabilities are computed to avoid needless cancellation and clamped to
        ``[eps, 1 - eps]`` (``eps`` the machine epsilon, matching R's own
        ``binomial()$linkinv``), so such a cell contributes approximately zero rather than a
        ``0/0``. An earlier implementation excluded by *computed* value instead of by structure,
        which made ``df`` depend on the link (Amendment 2's own "C1" finding) -- corrected here.
    pearson_chi2
        The Pearson chi-square statistic on the same cells, with the same exclusion and the
        same ``None``-on-``df <= 0`` rule as ``deviance``.
    df
        Degrees of freedom: the number of cells counted towards ``deviance``/``pearson_chi2``
        (after the structural exclusion above) minus the number of estimated parameters. Always
        an integer, even when it is zero or negative.
    dispersion
        ``pearson_chi2 / df`` (plan section 5.7's ``phi``), or ``None`` exactly when
        ``pearson_chi2`` is ``None`` (``df <= 0``). A value strictly greater than ``1.5`` adds a
        warning starting with ``"OVERDISPERSED: "``; nothing is rescaled and no interval
        changes as a result (plan section 5.7: reported, never acted on). ``phi`` can be
        dominated by a single observed event against a tiny expected count (`decisions/0023`
        Amendment 2's own "W1" finding) -- see ``warnings``' ``"SPARSE_CELLS: "`` entry, which
        flags exactly that case without changing ``dispersion`` itself.
    link_aic
        AIC for each of ``"probit"``, ``"logit"`` and ``"cloglog"``, refit under the same
        ``upper``/``lower`` specification as the diagnosed fit. The diagnosed fit's own link
        reuses its own ``log_likelihood`` and parameter count directly (never refit, so it is
        exact by construction); the other two links are refit through the existing statsmodels
        fitting paths (hard constraint 2). ``None`` for a link whose refit does not reach
        :data:`~marginkit.Status.OK` -- see ``link_status``.
    link_status
        The :class:`~marginkit.Status` of each link's own fit (the diagnosed fit's own status,
        which is always ``OK``, for its own link; the refit's status for the other two).
        ``link_aic[link] is None`` if and only if ``link_status[link] is not Status.OK``.
    warnings
        Free-text notes: the ``df <= 0`` reason, an ``"OVERDISPERSED: "`` token, or a
        ``"SPARSE_CELLS: "`` token naming a counted cell flagged on one side (successes or
        failures) because that side's expected count is below ``0.1`` *and* at least one event
        was actually observed there (`decisions/0023` Amendments 2-4) -- report-only, like
        ``"OVERDISPERSED: "``: it changes no number, only says that ``pearson_chi2`` and
        ``dispersion`` are unreliable at that cell. Empty by default.

    ----------
    obs
        The severity/outcome data to test.
    dependence
        ``None`` (the default) resolves to ``"independent"`` unless ``obs.cluster`` is set, in
        which case omitting it raises (R2: a method assuming independence must refuse clustered
        input unless the caller explicitly opts in). ``"independent"`` may always be passed
        explicitly; the resulting ``MonotonicityCheck.dependence`` is always ``"independent"`` in
        this release.
    alpha
        The significance level ``flagged`` is decided at (``holm_adjusted_p < alpha``), strictly
        between 0 and 1. Defaults to ``0.05``.

    Returns
    -------
    MonotonicityCheck
        ``pairs`` is empty (with a warning naming the reason) when ``obs`` has fewer than two
        distinct severity levels.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If ``dependence`` is not ``None`` or ``"independent"``; if ``obs.cluster`` is set and
        ``dependence`` is ``None``; or if ``alpha`` is not a finite number strictly between 0
        and 1.

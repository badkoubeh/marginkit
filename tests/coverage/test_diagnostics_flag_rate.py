"""Coverage simulation for the monotonicity check's false-positive rate (plan section 6.3's own
pattern, applied to plan section 5.7's monotonicity check;
``docs/decisions/0023-fit-diagnostics-and-schema-v3.md``'s "Amendment 1").

Marked ``slow`` and excluded from the default run, mirroring
``tests/coverage/test_profile_coverage.py``. Run locally with::

    pytest -m slow --no-cov

Simulates from a genuinely monotone probit (``u=0.9``, ``l=0.1``, ``mu=0``, ``s=0.5``) on an
11-level design (an exact-zero control plus ``logspace(-2, 2, 10)``), ``n=400`` per level, and
counts how often :func:`~marginkit.check_monotonicity`'s Holm-corrected check raises **any**
false flag across 2,000 replicates. Since the check needs only counts (Amendment 1's whole
point), every replicate is usable regardless of whether a curve could be fit to it -- unlike the
superseded per-``Diagnostics`` version of this simulation, there is no "failed fit" category
here at all. decisions/0023 states this design measured roughly 2-3% in the run that motivated
the Holm correction (a per-pair, uncorrected test was roughly 25% on the same design); this test
re-establishes that figure rather than relying on the record, and asserts the plan's own bound,
``<= 0.05``.

"""Coverage simulations for threshold intervals (plan section 6.3).

These are the only tests in the suite that check the *method* rather than the implementation.
The reference tests in ``tests/reference/`` prove marginkit computes the same numbers R does;
they cannot tell whether a 95% interval covers the truth 95% of the time. That is what this
file measures, by simulating from a known probit and counting how often the interval contains
the true threshold.

Marked ``slow`` and excluded from the default run by ``pyproject.toml``'s ``-m "not slow"``.
CI runs them once, in the ``coverage-simulations`` job, rather than on each of four matrix legs.
Run locally with::

    pytest -m slow --no-cov

**What is asserted and what is only recorded** (plan section 6.3): the rich, marginbench-like
design asserts profile coverage in ``[0.93, 0.97]``. The coarse, zeta-like 4-level design
**records without asserting** -- poor coverage on a 4-level grid is a finding for
``docs/validation.md``, not a bug. Printed results are what ``docs/validation.md`` quotes.

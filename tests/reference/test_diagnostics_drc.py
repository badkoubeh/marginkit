"""Reference-value parity for :func:`~marginkit.diagnose` against R's ``glm`` on ``finney71``
(plan sections 6.1, 5.7; ``docs/decisions/0023-fit-diagnostics-and-schema-v3.md``).

This file never runs R and never needs R installed -- it reads only the committed
``tools/drc_reference/finney71.json``. Every one of AIC, deviance and Pearson chi-square is
**derived from R's own fitted coefficients and log-likelihood, already in the fixture**
(``glm.<link>.coef``, ``glm.<link>.logLik``), not read from a not-yet-generated field: R's
fitted probability at each dose is ``linkinv(intercept + slope * log(dose))`` for the
``cbind(affected, total - affected) ~ log(dose)`` model the fixture's own ``glm`` block
describes, and deviance/Pearson are the ordinary binomial GOF formulas applied to that fitted
probability. This is the same "recompute from R's coefficients" approach
``tools/drc_reference/generate.R``'s own ``observed_hessian_check`` already uses for covariance.

``generate.R`` has also been extended (this phase) to have R itself compute and emit
``deviance``, ``pearson_chi2``, ``df_residual`` and ``AIC`` per ``glm`` link directly, as a
second, R-native cross-check -- but that requires re-running the pinned R container, which this
environment does not have. Until ``finney71.json`` is regenerated, the tests in
``TestAgainstRNativeGofFields`` below will fail with a ``KeyError`` naming the missing field:
that failure means "regenerate the fixture", not "the formula is wrong" (see this file's own
module docstring convention: a reference-value drift is a finding, not a test bug, but a
*missing* fixture field is simply outstanding fixture-generation work, flagged explicitly here
rather than silently skipped).

**Factual correction (decisions/0023 Amendment 2):** R's ``glm`` does not "drop" the exact
``dose == 0`` row -- ``tools/drc_reference/generate.R`` itself subsets that row *out of the data*
before ever calling ``glm``, because ``log(0)`` is undefined and would make the ``glm`` call
fail outright, not because ``glm`` has any special handling for an all-success control. The
resulting 5-row ``glm`` fit's ``df.residual`` (5 rows minus 2 estimated parameters) is what
``df == 3`` is compared against here. This is a **different** exclusion from marginkit's own:
``diagnose()`` excludes the ``dose == 0`` cell *structurally* -- a log-axis cell at severity
exactly ``0`` when ``upper`` is fixed at exactly ``1.0`` (Amendment 2, item 1) -- because that
cell has zero variance and zero deviance by construction under marginkit's own curve, not
because a numerically-saturated fitted probability was excluded (the pre-Amendment-2
implementation's bug, C1: excluding by *computed value* rather than by structure made ``df``
depend on the link). The two exclusions happen to agree on `finney71` (both drop exactly the
``dose == 0`` row), which is what makes the comparison below meaningful at all. drc's own `drm`,
by contrast, fits the *full* 6-row `finney71` (its `LN.2`/`LL.2` forms handle `dose == 0` on the
log scale directly), so drc's residual `df` is 4, not 3 -- recorded next to the fixture by
``generate.R``, not reproduced here since nothing in this file compares against drc's own fit.

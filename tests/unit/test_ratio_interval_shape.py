"""Fieller interval shapes (plan section 5.6): the full decision tree, as of ``decisions/0022``
(which supersedes part of ``0017``, narrows ``0021``, and amends ``0015``'s "Forecloses" clause).

``docs/STATISTICS.md`` and ``decisions/0017``/``0019``/``0021``/``0022`` record the closed form
this file computes independently and compares ``ratio_interval()`` against: solve
``A*rho^2 - 2*B*rho + K = 0`` for ``A = theta_b^2 - z^2*Vb``, ``B = theta_a*theta_b - z^2*C``,
``K = theta_a^2 - z^2*Va`` (``C = 0`` under ``dependence="independent"``, so ``B > 0`` whenever
both severities are positive); the confidence set is ``{rho : A*rho^2 - 2*B*rho + K <= 0}``,
intersected with the positive parameter space before being reported. The full, current branch
table (``_expected_shape_and_bounds`` below is this table, executable):

- **``A > 0``** (``g < 1``): always ``BOUNDED`` -- the discriminant is always positive here (the
  point estimate itself is a root of the boundary, `docs/STATISTICS.md`). If the lower root is
  negative (``K <= 0``), it is clipped to ``0`` -- ``decisions/0019`` -- with ``hi`` untouched
  and the unclipped root named in ``warnings``. This branch, and its clip, are unaffected by
  ``0022`` (`decisions/0022`: "the upper-only geometry stays ``BOUNDED``").
- **``A == 0``** (``g == 1`` exactly, `decisions/0017`): the quadratic degenerates to the linear
  ``-2*B*rho + K = 0``, root ``rho = K/(2*B)``. If ``K > 0`` this is a genuine positive lower
  bound -- **``HALF_OPEN`` with ``lo = K/(2*B)``, superseding ``0017`` for this sub-case**
  (`decisions/0022`). If ``K <= 0`` the root is at or below zero, so intersected with the
  positive axis the set is all of ``(0, inf)`` -- ``UNBOUNDED``, ``0017`` unchanged.
- **``A < 0``** with a non-positive discriminant: ``UNBOUNDED`` (`decisions/0017`, unaffected by
  ``0022`` -- there are no real roots to intersect at all).
- **``A < 0``** with a positive discriminant: the two roots are opposite-signed whenever
  ``K > 0`` (product of roots ``= K/A < 0``), so intersected with the positive axis only the
  positive root survives -- **``HALF_OPEN`` with ``lo`` = that positive root**
  (`decisions/0022`, superseding the ``EXCLUSIVE`` this branch previously reported: measured at
  ~24% of reachable Fieller results under independence, not the rare case ``0017`` assumed when
  it decided the frozen-enum cost wasn't worth paying). When ``K <= 0`` instead, both roots are
  negative (`decisions/0021`) and the set is again all of ``(0, inf)`` -- ``UNBOUNDED``.
- **``EXCLUSIVE`` is unreachable through ``ratio_interval()`` in v0.1.** It would need
  same-signed roots with ``A < 0``, which needs ``B <= 0``, which needs ``C > 0`` -- only
  possible once ``dependence="paired"`` lands in v0.2 (`decisions/0022`'s own consequence). The
  member stays in ``IntervalShape`` and ``Ratio``'s invariants for it stay enforced (tested
  directly, not through ``ratio_interval``, in ``TestExclusiveRemainsAValidRatioShapeForV02``).

**The primary versions of every shape here construct their ``Fit``/``Threshold`` objects
directly rather than fitting real data**, so the expected ``Va``/``Vb`` are known exactly and
``ratio_interval()``'s output can be checked against the closed form above to a tight tolerance,
not just by shape name. There is no lower-level "shape-selection helper" to call instead:
``marginkit/ratio.py`` holds ``Ratio`` and ``ratio_interval()`` together, with no separately
importable shape computation, so every case here goes through the public ``ratio_interval()``
end-to-end on hand-built inputs, which is the smallest thing that can be tested.

**``g >= 1`` is also reachable through a real fit, confirmed by search, not assumed impossible.**
It needs a denominator threshold whose relative log-scale uncertainty exceeds ``1/z`` (about 51%
at ``level=0.95``), which turns out to need a design sitting right at the edge of separation: two
adjacent severity levels, a small ``n`` (20), and a near-flat, barely-decreasing success pattern
(``5/20`` then ``4/20``) that barely constrains the slope at all.
``TestHalfOpenAndUnboundedFromRealFits`` below reproduces both ``HALF_OPEN`` and ``UNBOUNDED``
this way (same poorly-determined denominator fit paired with a tightly- or loosely-determined
numerator respectively), confirming the constructed cases above are not testing a mathematical
curiosity that never arises in practice -- only that it takes a design bad enough to be at the
edge of ``SEPARATION``/``NOT_CONVERGED`` territory, not an ordinary one. Because a real fit's
``Va``/``Vb`` are whatever the optimizer converges to (not a round number chosen ahead of time),
that class checks ``shape`` and containment rather than exact endpoints -- the exact-value check
is what the constructed cases above are for.

The natural-scale variance identity used to build these fixtures precisely,
``Va = value^2 * sigma_log^2`` (``sigma_log`` being the same log-scale delta standard error
``intervals.delta_interval`` already computes internally, and the same quantity
``tests/reference/test_threshold_drc_ed.py`` reconstructs from a real ``Threshold``'s own
``lo``/``hi``), is an exact consequence of the delta method's chain rule
(``Var(exp(theta)) = exp(theta)^2 * Var(theta)`` to first order, for *any* function of the
underlying parameters, not an extra approximation on top of it) -- not an assumption specific to
this test file.

"""Executes every fenced ```python block in ``README.md``, so its examples cannot silently rot
as the public API changes underneath them (requested alongside decisions/0023 Amendment 1's
finney71 worked example, which will land in the README later -- this test already covers
whatever ```python blocks exist today, and will pick up the new one automatically once it is
added, with no test change needed).

Each block is executed in its own fresh namespace (not accumulated top-to-bottom): every block
in the README already re-imports what it needs, so this does not assume any cross-block reading
order and catches a block that silently depended on a name defined earlier by accident.

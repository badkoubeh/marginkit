"""Real-data regression: ``threshold()`` on ``tests/data/zeta_matrix_counts.csv`` (plan
section 6.5, `docs/decisions/0008`, `0010`, `0011`).

Every series here is a genuine edge case from zeta-bench's committed matrix (plan section 3.1),
not a synthetic construction -- a status or censoring change on this file is either a real
statistical finding or a real bug, never something to paper over by adjusting the assertion
(``CLAUDE.md``). Status and censoring are asserted for every series; numeric ``value``/``lo``/
``hi`` are asserted only for the identifiable ``pid_sensor_noise`` series (plan section 6.5's own
restriction).

Status/Censoring member coverage *not* reachable from this CSV (``CONTROL_INCOMPATIBLE``,
``NOT_CONVERGED``, ``OPEN_UPPER``/``OPEN_LOWER``, and the ``UNREACHABLE`` routes) lives in
``tests/unit/test_threshold_status_coverage.py`` instead, on constructed data -- kept separate
so this file stays a pure snapshot of the real matrix.

    magnitude-based ``Observations``, one per side -- the schema does not model a signed scalar
    axis at all). **What this skips:** there is no way to call the public API with the raw
    signed ``ppo_mass`` series directly (``Observations.from_counts`` raises on the negative
    ``-0.2``/``-0.1`` rows), so this only covers the magnitude-split form, matching
    ``tests/unit/test_models_zeta.py::_ppo_mass_by_magnitude``'s own split.

    Both magnitude series converge to ``Status.OK`` with fixed ``upper=1.0, lower=0.0``
    (confirmed: ``test_ppo_mass_positive_magnitude_u_1_l_0_is_ok`` /
    ``..._negative_magnitude_..._is_ok``), and each fitted ``mu`` (~0.084 positive side, ~0.13
    negative side) lies strictly inside its own tested range ``[0.0, 0.2]``. **This does not
    give ``NONE`` censoring with a profile interval** -- `docs/decisions/0012` settles that
    §5.5's ``RIGHT``/``LEFT`` conditions are evaluated on the data and outrank a converged fit.
    On both magnitude sides, the control passes ``absolute(0.95)`` (exact one-sided lower bound
    ``0.9534 > 0.95`` on the shared ``99/100`` control) while **no nonzero level passes**:
    positive ``0.1: 33/100`` has exact upper bound ``0.4155``; negative ``0.1: 77/100`` has exact
    upper bound ``0.8374``; both well below ``0.95``, and ``0.2`` fails even more clearly on
    either side. decisions/0012 distinguishes this from ``pid_sensor_noise`` (§5.5's plain
    interior case), where ``0.01 -> 299/300`` genuinely passes and ``0.05 -> 122/300`` fails --
    *some* nonzero level passes there, so the crossing interpolates between two measured points
    and keeps its number. Here, with no nonzero level passing on either side, the crossing is
    only bracketed by the unmeasured control-to-``0.1`` gap, so it is ``LEFT`` with the bound at
    the lowest nonzero severity (``0.1``), on both sides, despite the fit itself being ``OK``
    with an interior ``mu``.

    ``(Status.OK, Censoring.LEFT)`` is one of the fourteen ``(status, censoring)`` pairs the
    frozen Phase 3 contract (``marginkit.testing.fake_threshold``'s
    ``_ALLOWED_THRESHOLD_COMBINATIONS``) already allows -- this is what makes it reachable at

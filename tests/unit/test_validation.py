"""Unit tests for ``marginkit.validation``'s **model-only** diagnostics:
:class:`~marginkit.Diagnostics` and :func:`~marginkit.diagnose` (plan section 5.7,
``docs/decisions/0023-fit-diagnostics-and-schema-v3.md``, as amended by that decision's
"Amendment 1").

Amendment 1 moves the adjacent-pair monotonicity check out of ``Diagnostics`` entirely and onto
``Fit.monotonicity`` (a :class:`~marginkit.MonotonicityCheck`, populated on *every*
``fit_dose_response`` return path, whatever the ``Status``) -- because a check that needs only
raw counts should not disappear when the curve fit fails. Those tests live in
``tests/unit/test_monotonicity.py`` now, not here. This file covers exactly what
``Diagnostics`` keeps: goodness of fit, dispersion, and link comparison -- all of which still
require a converged fit and are still ``None`` for a non-``OK`` one.

Written before the implementation exists (plan section 6, ``CLAUDE.md``'s working rhythm):
every expected number here is computed *independently* of ``marginkit.validation`` -- directly
from the binomial deviance/Pearson/AIC formulas via ``scipy``, or by a from-scratch Holm
step-down -- exactly the "unit test that computes the formulas directly" decisions/0023 itself
promises for the estimated-asymptote path (which has no R ``glm`` equivalent). ``diagnose()`` is
expected to agree with that independent computation to floating-point precision, not to within a
loose tolerance: a formula bug should never hide behind a wide ``pytest.approx``.

**Which cells count towards goodness of fit** (``docs/decisions/0023-fit-diagnostics-and-schema-
v3.md``'s "Amendment 2"; this file's own C1 finding). A cell is excluded from deviance, Pearson
chi-square and the cell count feeding ``df`` **only** when it is *structurally* deterministic
under the model: a log-axis cell at severity exactly ``0.0`` when ``upper`` is *fixed* at ``1.0``
(``direction="decreasing"``). That cell has zero variance and zero deviance by construction --
excluding it is what makes the diagnostics invariant to an all-success control. Every other cell
is counted, including one whose *computed* fitted probability happens to round to ``0`` or ``1``
in double precision (probabilities are clamped to ``[eps, 1 - eps]``, ``eps`` = R's
``.Machine$double.eps``, exactly as R's own ``binomial()$linkinv`` does, so such a cell
contributes approximately zero to both statistics and exactly ``1`` to ``df`` rather than a
``0/0``). Under an *estimated* ``upper``, the control identifies ``u`` and is always counted,
even if its value happens to equal ``1.0`` -- ``TestControlCountedWhenUpperIsEstimated`` below
pins this down directly.

**This corrects an earlier, wrong version of this same paragraph** (excluding by *computed*
value rather than by structure), which is exactly the bug Amendment 2's own "C1" finding
describes: excluding whenever a computed probability rounded to 0 or 1 made ``df`` depend on the
link (7 for probit/cloglog, 8 for logit, on the saturating grid ``TestStructuralDfExclusion``
below pins to 8 for all three), because probit/logit/cloglog saturate to floating-point 0/1 at
different ``z`` magnitudes. R's own ``glm`` never has this problem, and R's convention that
motivated the original (wrong) rule was actually the *structural* one all along -- see the
factual correction in ``tests/reference/test_diagnostics_drc.py``'s own module docstring.

**``SPARSE_CELLS:`` (Amendment 2 item 3, corrected by Amendment 3).** Amendment 2's own wording
flagged a counted cell whenever the expected count on a side (successes or failures) fell below
1, with no further condition. Amendment 3 found that this fires on essentially every correctly
specified rich-design fit -- an all-success or all-failure *plateau* cell far from the transition
has an expected count near zero on its "sparse" side, but since nothing was ever actually
observed there, that near-zero expectation is not a finding, just an artifact of clean data. The
corrected rule flags a side only when **both** the expected count is below a cutoff **and** the
observed count on that same side is at least 1 -- a genuine event against a small expectation,
which is the actual pathology the warning exists for (zeta PID x sensor_noise's 1 observed
failure where about 0.005 were expected).

**Amendment 4 tightened the cutoff from below 1 to below 0.1.** Amendment 3 alone still fired on
about 57.5% of correctly specified fits on the rich design (control + ``logspace(-2, 2, 10)``,
n=400, probit, ``mu=0``, ``s=0.5``): two grid points near the transition (about 0.215 and 4.64)
expect about 0.43 events on their sparse side, so a single observed event there is ordinary, not
a finding -- this is exactly the near-transition risk this file's own
``TestSparseCellsSilentOnCleanPlateaus`` documented empirically (11 of 20 seeded replicates fired
under Amendment 3) before Amendment 4 was decided. At the tightened cutoff those two cells no
longer qualify at all (0.43 is not below 0.1), which is what makes the rich design's false-warning
rate drop to about 0%. ``TestSparseCellsWarning`` below now needs three roles, not two, to pin
both conditions: a cell below the cutoff with an event (flagged), a cell below the cutoff with no
event (silent, Amendment 3's own case), and a cell *at or above* the new cutoff but still below
the old one, with an event (silent, pinning the 0.1 boundary itself).

# The dataset below replaces an earlier one "found by search" (severity=[2,3,10],
# successes=[10,4,3], trials=[15,5,5]) that pinned cloglog's own NOT_CONVERGED as a fixed
# literal: 3 cells against 3 estimated parameters (mu, s, upper) put convergence on a knife
# edge that flipped with platform and library versions (CI found py3.11/Linux converging
# probit and logit too at latest dependencies, and cloglog converging instead at the
# minimum-versions floor) -- a test-design flaw, not a statistical finding. The dataset here is
# deliberately over-determined instead: 6 cells (including a zero-severity control anchoring the
# estimated ``upper``), n=200 per cell, a smooth monotone success schedule spanning the full
# dynamic range with no cell near a separation or sparse-count boundary -- verified locally to
# converge for all three links with comfortable margin, not merely found to converge once.

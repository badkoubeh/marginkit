"""Check the built sdist and wheel in ``dist/`` before they are published.

Run after ``python -m build``: ``python tools/check_dist.py [--expect-version X.Y.Z]``. Both the
``packaging shape`` CI job and the release workflow call this file, so there is one copy of the
check (CLAUDE.md, on second copies of a rule).

A missing ``py.typed`` fails silently and disables type checking for every consumer, and
``load_schema(version)`` reads the packaged schemas at runtime, so both are asserted inside the
built wheel rather than merely on disk.

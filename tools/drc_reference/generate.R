# marginkit's R `drc` reference fixtures (plan sections 6.1-6.2, Phase 4 plan).
#
# Writes JSON files under tools/drc_reference/ that Phase 4-6 tests read. Tests never run R
# themselves (hard constraint 1: R is a local tool only, never an importable dependency); this
# script is how the fixtures get (re)generated, by hand, in the pinned container documented in
# tools/drc_reference/README.md.
#
# Every JSON file records the R, drc and MASS versions actually used, plus (where relevant) the
# drc -> marginkit parameter mapping this run empirically confirmed:
#   mu = log(e); s is +-1/b depending on which response was fit and which direction it moves in
#   (see the "mapping" block written into each file -- section 5.1's "check drc's sign
#   convention" turned into a recorded fact, not a comment).
#
# Run via the exact container command in the README. Do not run against a host R install: the
# CRAN snapshot and package versions must be pinned and reproducible.
